 ** ABOUT ** 

This program is an RTSP proxy derived from the proxy source code 
released from RealNetworks.
This version include a caching system that saves multimedia streams
that traverse the proxy and playback then once required other times.

 ** INSTALL **

To compile the program you have to follow the "standard" procedure:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install 

!!!! NOTE !!!!
Please check you CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables. Normally
configure will add a -g3 switch to have full debug symbols. This may 
conflicts with other switchs (such as -O2 or so...). These conflicts
may end in segmentation faults or other errors at run-time. 
So if you experienced such problems please check that you are using
clean environment variables:

$ make distclean
$ export CFLAGS=""
$ export CXXFLAGS=""
$ ./configure 
$ make

If errors persist, then it's a bug in rtspproxy. Please send a report.

If all went fine, you have the executable installed..

Now it's time the edit the configuration file.. 
an example is provided here : rtspproxy.conf.
The syntax is very simple and the comments explain all 
the options.
Edit as you need and save it in "the right place".
The proxy will look for the configuration file in these 
places :	'./rtspproxy.conf' 
		'~/.rtspproxy.conf' 
		'/etc/rtspproxy.conf'

 ** USAGE **

$ rtspproxy

If you call the proxy without command line parameter, it will use the 
defaults settings or the settings specified in the configuration file.
